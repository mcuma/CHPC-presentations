# CHPC presentations main GIT page

To set up a repo with two remotes, one at github and another at CHPC gitlab, do the following:
```
$ git init
$ git add *
$ git commit -am "initial commit"
```
Now create empty repos both on github and CHPC gitlab, and once those are ready:
```
$ git remote add origin git@github.com:CHPC-UofU/CHPC-presentations.git
$ git remote set-url --add origin git@gitlab.chpc.utah.edu:training/chpc-presentations.git

```

## Use for other CHPC staff members


### Initial repo setup in your home
1. First clone the existing repo
```
$ git clone git@github.com:CHPC-UofU/CHPC-presentations.git
```
2. Add the other remote:
```
$ cd CHPC-presentations
$ git remote set-url --add origin git@gitlab.chpc.utah.edu:training/chpc-presentations.git
```
3. Add a new directory with files for the given presentation:
```
$ mkdir my-new-presentation
$ cp /path-to/my-presentation.pptx my-new-presentation
```
4. Commit the repository change and push it to the remotes
```
$ git commit -am 'added my-new-presentation'
$ git push origin master
```

### Updates of existing local repo
1. Make sure that the local and remote are synchronized:
```
$ git pull
```
merge if necessary.
2. Add/update some files
3. Commit the repository change and push to the remotes
```
$ git commit -am 'added my-new-presentation'
$ git push origin master
```

### Shortening URLs

The URLs of the individual presentations may end up being fairly long, which will make it difficult to include into the Powerpoint slide. We can use URL shortener git.io to make those URL shorters. Custom short page name has to be done through the curl command, e.g.:
```
curl -i https://git.io -F "url=https://github.com/CHPC-UofU/CHPC-presentations/tree/master/Intro-to-Parallel-Computing/R-examples" -F "code=CHPC-Intro-to-Parallel-Computing-R"
```

will shorten the ```https://github.com/CHPC-UofU/CHPC-presentations/tree/master/Intro-to-Parallel-Computing/R-examples``` to ```https://git.io/CHPC-Intro-to-Parallel-Computing-R```
